# authentication

Practice

// Starting up you need to install
-express,
-jsonwebtoken,
-dotenv,
-nodmemon

//Edit on package.json to run server
Add "devStart": "nodemon server.js" under scripts

//Instead of POSTMAN I am using a VSC extension called REST client

//Add code in server.js in order for the program to read express and GET, POST and listen to PORT

//Add tokens in order to mesmorize user once logged in but has a timer before the token becomes invalid
